;;; Commentary:
;; There's a ton of different ways of doing package management in Emacs, most of
;; which nowadays revolve around `use-package'. There's also `quelpa',
;; `straight.el', `Borg' and a bunch more. I've tried them all, but there is
;; always some minute thing about them that bothers me. In the end I've ended up
;; configuring the packages I need in a `Nix' expression, allowing me to
;; declarative install dependencies.

;; I still use `use-package' to configure my installed packages, but the
;; `:ensure' functionality of it is disabled. This gives me the best of both
;; worlds, all the great functionality and integration of `use-package' and the
;; declarative packaging that you would have with `straight.el' or `Borg'.

;;; Code:
;; Require `use-package', need I say more?
(eval-and-compile
  (require 'use-package))

(csetq use-package-ensure-function 'ignore ;; We don't want to install packages with `use-package'

;;;; `delight':
;; Though you could use `diminish' for making the modeline look better,
;; `delight' is a much better package. Not only can you change the names or hide
;; major-modes from the modeline, you can also nest what minor-mode you want to
;; hide instead of having to do it one at a time.
