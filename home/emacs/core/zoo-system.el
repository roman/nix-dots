;; Neptune (NixOS): Configures and enables copying and pasting between Emacs and
;; X11 and choses the builtin tooltips over GTK.

;;        select-enable-primary t                                        ;; Use the primary clipboard
;;        x-gtk-use-system-tooltips nil                                  ;; Use the builtin Emacs tooltips
;;        x-underline-at-descent-line t                                  ;; Fix for not using GTK tooltips
;;        zoo-font-size 60                                          ;; Make the font smaller on Neptune
;;        zoo-line-spacing 0.10)                                    ;; And the spacing a little less
