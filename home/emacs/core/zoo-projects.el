;;; Commentary:
;; Configures Projectile for some sweet, sweet project awesomeness.

;;; Code:
;;; `projectile':
;; Projectile is a program for working with projects in Emacs, it supports a ton
;; of features out of the box that are awesome and useful, like searching for
;; files only in the current project, recent files in current project and so on.
(use-package projectile
  :demand t
  :commands projectile-mode
  :delight "â“…"
  :general
  (zoo-leader
    "p" '(projectile-command-map :wk "project"))
  :init
  (progn
    (csetq projectile-completion-system 'ivy ;; Use Ivy for completion
           projectile-sort-order 'recentf    ;; Sort by using `recentf'
           projectile-enable-caching t))     ;; Enable caching to speed up searching, finding files
  :config (projectile-mode))

;;; `counsel-projectile':
;; Even though we've configured Projectile to use Ivy, we can extend it even
;; more by also using Counsel too.
(use-package counsel-projectile
  :after projectile
  :commands counsel-projectile-mode
