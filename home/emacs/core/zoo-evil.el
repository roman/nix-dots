;;; Commentary:
;; Configures `Evil' and all it's ilk.

;;; Code:

;;; `Evil':
;; Configures evil-mode.

  :config

;;; `evil-collection':
;; A collective effort to create keybindings for various packages that work with
;; Evil, probably the best thing since Evil.
(use-package evil-collection
  :after evil
  :config
  (evil-collection-init))

;;; `evil-lion':
;; Ever wanted to align a long bunch of variables at their equal signs? Look no
;; further, because that is exactly what this does.
(use-package evil-lion
  :commands evil-lion-mode
  :config (evil-lion-mode))

;;; `evil-commentary':
;; Quickly comment out a single line or a region. It's really neat.
(use-package evil-commentary
  :delight
  :commands evil-commentary-mode
  :init (evil-commentary-mode))

;;; `evil-surround':
;; Incredibly handy package, if you want to change what surrounds a text you can
;; use this to easily do that. Change `[' and it's closing brother to a pair of
;; `()'? `cs[(' and you're done.
(use-package evil-surround
  :commands global-evil-surround-mode
  :init (global-evil-surround-mode))

;;; `evil-goggles':
;; Show visual hints for what the action you just did. It's hard to tell without
;; explaining it, I recommend you check out the README on GitHub.
(use-package evil-goggles
  :delight
  :commands evil-goggles-mode
